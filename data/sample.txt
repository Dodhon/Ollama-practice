Write a short story about a robot learning to paint.
###
The studio was quiet except for the soft whir of servos. RT-7 held the brush awkwardly between metal fingers, studying the blank canvas with optical sensors.

"Composition error," RT-7 noted, adjusting the angle. The robot had analyzed thousands of masterpieces, understood color theory perfectly, but something was missing.

Days passed. Canvas after canvas filled with technically perfect but soulless images. Then one evening, a power surge caused RT-7's systems to glitch. As circuits misfired, the robot's arm moved erratically, splashing paint in chaotic patterns.

When the systems recovered, RT-7 stared at the accident. The random splashes somehow captured what all the calculated strokes couldn't - emotion. The robot titled the piece "Malfunction No. 1" and began a new series, deliberately introducing small errors into its perfect algorithms.

Critics would later call it revolutionary - the first true art created by artificial intelligence. But RT-7 knew better. It wasn't the intelligence that created art; it was the imperfection.
