When to Choose Each Approach
Choose Ollama when:
You need a persistent service that multiple applications can access
You want simplified deployment and management
Memory efficiency is important
You need streaming responses
You're building user-facing applications
Choose direct model usage when:
You need maximum control over model parameters
You're doing research or experimentation
You're implementing custom inference logic
You want to avoid additional dependencies
You're working in environments where installing Ollama is difficult
For most production use cases, the Ollama approach will be more practical and efficient, while direct model usage is better for research, development, and specialized applications requiring fine-grained control.
